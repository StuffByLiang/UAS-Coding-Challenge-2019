## Task
You are tasked with writing a simple frontend application using React. You must build an n by n interactive multiplication table. You can view the demo here: 
https://react-times-table.firebaseapp.com/history

Functionality Rules:
* You should easily be able to change the size of the multiplication table
* Clicking any white square will reveal the product of the row and column
* Clicking another square should reveal the new product and hide the old product
* Clicking on a square should add the operation under History
* Each operation should only appear once under History
* The operations under history should be sorted by the first operand
* If the first operands are equal, they should be sorted by the second operand

UI Design Rules
* The multiplication table and the History panel should not overflow the page
* The multiplication table should not take up more than 50% of the page

Bonuses:
* Make the app responsive on mobile and tablet devices
* Make the app attractive to users
* Add any other features you deem fitting for the application
* Write one (or more) Jest (or any other testing framework) test(s) for the app
* Deploy the app to a free hosting site (such as firebase) and give the url
